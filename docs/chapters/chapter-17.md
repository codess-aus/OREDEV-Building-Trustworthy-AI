# Chapter 17: Automated evaluation for models and apps  

![Image 17 - Automated](../images/17.%20Automated.png)  


## Overview

Automated evaluation is useful for measuring quality and safety on a bigger scale. Azure AI Foundry evaluation tools also enable ongoing evaluations that periodically run to monitor for regression as the system, usage, and mitigations evolve over time.

### Scaling Evaluation with Automation

Once you understand your quality requirements through manual evaluation, automation provides scale:

- **Batch Processing**: Evaluate thousands of outputs quickly
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Run evaluations on production traffic automatically
- **Regression Detection**: Alert when quality metrics degrade over time
- **CI/CD Integration**: Gate deployments on evaluation thresholds with GitHub Actions
- **Cost Efficiency**: Automated evaluation is far cheaper than human annotation at scale

### Azure AI Foundry Automated Evaluation

Azure provides comprehensive automated evaluation capabilities:

- **Cloud Evaluations**: Run large-scale evaluations in Azure AI Foundry
- **Scheduled Jobs**: Periodic evaluations to catch regression
- **GitHub Actions Integration**: Automate evaluation in your development workflow
- **Custom Metrics**: Define domain-specific evaluators alongside built-in metrics

Automation doesn't replace human judgment—it amplifies it. Use manual evaluation to build intuition, then scale with Azure's automated evaluation tools.
