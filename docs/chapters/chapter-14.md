# Chapter 14: Design for Observable Trust Signals  

![Image 14 - Observe](../images/14.%20Observe.png)  

## Overview

Continuously improve and monitor your AI Agents:  

We need to design our systems so that trust is not just assumed, but observable and measurable. In practice, this means continuously improving and monitoring our AI agents—not just for performance, but for impact, quality, safety, and cost.  

With tools like Azure AI Foundry, we can track key operational and evaluation metrics in real time—such as groundedness, relevance, fluency, and intent resolution. These metrics help us spot issues early, ensure our AI is behaving as intended, and give us the confidence to develop and operate AI responsibly in production.  

Ultimately, designing for observable trust signals means making trust visible—not just to developers, but to business users and stakeholders as well. It’s about building AI that earns trust every day, through transparency, accountability, and continuous improvement
