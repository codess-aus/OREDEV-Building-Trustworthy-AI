# Chapter 16: Manual evaluation for models and apps


![Image 16 - Manual](../images/16.%20Manual.png)  

## Overview

We recommend that you always start with manual evaluation, with human graders manually scoring generated outputs.

When mitigating specific risks, it's really helpful to keep manually checking progress against a small dataset until evidence of the risk is no longer observed before moving on to automated evaluation.

Azure AI Foundry provides an easy no-code interface for developers or domain experts to grade model outputs.

### The Value of Manual Evaluation

Human judgment remains critical for nuanced quality assessment:

- **Build Intuition**: Understand failure modes before automating
- **Catch Edge Cases**: Identify issues automated metrics might miss
- **Domain Expertise**: Leverage subject matter expert knowledge
- **Iterative Refinement**: Quickly test mitigations on small datasets
- **Benchmark Creation**: Generate ground truth for automated metrics

### Azure AI Foundry Manual Evaluation

Azure provides user-friendly tools for manual evaluation:

- **No-Code Interface**: Developers and domain experts can grade outputs without coding
- **Annotation Workflows**: Structured evaluation with custom criteria
- **Team Collaboration**: Multiple graders can assess the same outputs
- **Export and Analysis**: Results integrate with automated evaluation pipelines

Start manual, scale automated. Manual evaluation builds the understanding you need to design effective automated evaluation strategies.
