# Chapter 16: Manual evaluation for models and apps


![Image 16 - Manual](../images/16.%20Manual.png)  

## Overview

We recommend that you always start with manual evaluation, with human graders manually scoring generated outputs.  

When mitigating specific risks, it’s really helpful to keep manually checking progress against a small dataset until evidence of the risk is no longer observed before moving on to automated evaluation.  

Azure AI Foundry provides an easy no-code interface for developers or domain experts to grade model outputs.
