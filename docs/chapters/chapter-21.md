# Chapter 21: Establish On-going Verification Loops

![Image 21 - Verification Loops](../images/21.%20Verification%20Loops.png)  

## Overview

Powers visibility, monitoring and optimization across the entire AI development lifecycle
The bottom line is that measurement is critical to iterative development and getting apps into production.

Periodic Audits: Review agent behaviour regularly, not just after incidents. Use agentic automated tools and human review.

Incident Response Integration: When agents go off-script, the process for root cause analysis and correction must be as robust as incident management for production systems.

Reward Learning: Incentivize agents (via their optimization objectives) to not just maximize task outcomes, but also minimize negative feedback and override rates.
