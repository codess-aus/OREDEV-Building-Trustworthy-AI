# Chapter 21: Establish On-going Verification Loops

![Image 21 - Verification Loops](../images/21.%20Verification%20Loops.png)  

## Overview

Powers visibility, monitoring and optimization across the entire AI development lifecycle. The bottom line is that measurement is critical to iterative development and getting apps into production.

**Periodic Audits**: Review agent behaviour regularly, not just after incidents. Use agentic automated tools and human review.

**Incident Response Integration**: When agents go off-script, the process for root cause analysis and correction must be as robust as incident management for production systems.

**Reward Learning**: Incentivize agents (via their optimization objectives) to not just maximize task outcomes, but also minimize negative feedback and override rates.

### Building Verification Loops

Ongoing verification transforms one-time testing into continuous quality assurance:

- **Scheduled Evaluations**: Automated quality checks run daily or weekly
- **Production Monitoring**: Real-time evaluation of live traffic
- **Feedback Integration**: User corrections and ratings feed back into evaluation
- **Regression Alerts**: Notify teams when metrics degrade
- **Root Cause Analysis**: Link evaluation failures to specific system changes

### Azure AI Foundry Verification Tools

Azure provides comprehensive ongoing verification capabilities:

- **Evaluation Pipelines**: Schedule automated evaluations in Azure AI Foundry
- **Application Insights**: Continuous monitoring with custom metrics and alerts
- **GitHub Actions**: Integrate verification into CI/CD workflows
- **Feedback APIs**: Capture user feedback programmatically

Verification loops close the quality feedback cycle—measure, learn, improve, repeat. With Azure's monitoring and GitHub's automation, verification becomes continuous rather than episodic.
