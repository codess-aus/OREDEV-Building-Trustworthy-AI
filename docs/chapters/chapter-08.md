# Chapter 8: Security as Core Design, Not Perimeter Defence  

![Image 8 - Security](../images/8.%20Security.png)  


## Overview

Agents will interact with sensitive data, make financial transactions, and initiate workflows. The attack surface increases exponentially as agency increases.  

**Security-first agent design:**  
  
- Principle of Least Privilege: Limit the scope of what an agent can do. Start with minimal permissions, expand as proven trustworthy.  
- Identity & Access Management: Every agent must have an immutable identity and verifiable credentials. Actions must be signed and attributable.  
- Real-time Threat Detection: Agents should be able to detect and respond to anomalous behavior, their own and others’. Self-awareness of compromise is as vital as external defenses.
