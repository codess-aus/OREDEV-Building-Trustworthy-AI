## Overview

Microsoft has been researching AI and putting AI to work in our products for decades, from web search to productivity tools to Azure. 

As a consequence, we’ve had the opportunity and privilege to be at the forefront of developing technology responsibly for nearly fifty years. 

Our experience over the past five decades has taught us that trust is not a given. It must be earned. 

Consider that 72% of everyday consumers say they want transparency around a company’s AI policies, and many will switch providers if their trust is broken.

It shouldn’t surprise anyone that the companies investing in responsible AI – investing in trust  – are also the companies seeing stronger loyalty among employees and customers and higher growth potential.
