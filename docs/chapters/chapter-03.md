# Chapter 3: The ultimate impact of generative AI hinges on Trust  

![Image 3 - Trust](../images/3.%20Trust.png)

## Overview

Microsoft has been researching AI and putting AI to work in our products for decades, from web search to productivity tools to Azure. 

As a consequence, we've had the opportunity and privilege to be at the forefront of developing technology responsibly for nearly fifty years. 

Our experience over the past five decades has taught us that trust is not a given. It must be earned. 

Consider that 72% of everyday consumers say they want transparency around a company's AI policies, and many will switch providers if their trust is broken. It shouldn't surprise anyone that the companies investing in responsible AI – investing in trust – are also the companies seeing stronger loyalty among employees and customers and higher growth potential.

### Trust as Competitive Advantage

The impact of generative AI hinges entirely on trust. Without it, even the most capable AI system remains unused:

- **Transparency Builds Confidence**: Users need to understand how AI makes decisions
- **Accountability Drives Adoption**: Clear responsibility chains enable enterprise deployment
- **Safety Enables Scale**: Robust safeguards allow AI to tackle mission-critical tasks
- **Reliability Ensures ROI**: Consistent, trustworthy outputs deliver measurable business value

Azure AI Foundry embeds these trust principles into every service—from evaluation metrics that measure groundedness and fairness, to content safety filters that protect users, to comprehensive monitoring that keeps teams informed. Trust isn't just good ethics; it's good business.
