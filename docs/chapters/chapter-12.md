![Image 12 - Measure](../images/12.%20Measure.png)  

## Overview

You can thoroughly assess the performance of your generative AI application by applying it to a substantial dataset. Evaluate the application in your development environment with the Azure AI Evaluation SDK.  

When you provide either a test dataset or a target, your generative AI application outputs are quantitatively measured with both mathematical-based metrics and AI-assisted quality and safety evaluators. Built-in or custom evaluators can provide you with comprehensive insights into the application's capabilities and limitations.
