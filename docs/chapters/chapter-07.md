# Chapter 7: Reliability under Uncertainty  

![Image 7 - Reliability](../images/7.%20Reliability.png)  

## Overview

Enterprises operate under constraints like regulatory, legal, reputational. Agents must embody those boundaries.  

How is this enforced?  

Policy Codification: Encode company policies and ethical rules as first-class constraints in the agent’s reasoning engine. For example: “Never approve spend above $10,000 without two signatures,” or, “Never share PII outside the EU.”  

Dynamic Policy Updates: As regulations evolve, agents must be able to adapt without wholesale retraining. This demands modular architectures, where policy layers are abstracted from underlying ML models.  

Human Override: At all times, ensure a path for human intervention and override. Trust is built not just on autonomy, but on the assurance that control can be regained.
