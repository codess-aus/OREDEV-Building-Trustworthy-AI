## Overview

🧭 Act 1: The Call to Adventure

Developers write the code the world runs on, and with Gen AI, we're changing how things work. But with great power comes great responsibility. We can go faster, increase productivity, collaboration, and innovation, but if we don't ensure what we build is worth building, it's worse than vaporware.

## Learning Objectives

**1. Plan a Responsible Generative AI Solution**

We'll cover the basics of responsible AI and how to get started right.

**2. Identify Potential Harms**

Next, we'll identify potential harms our AI might cause. We'll discuss common pitfalls and how to spot them early.

**3. Measure Potential Harms**

Once we've identified potential harms, it's time to measure them. We'll look at ways to assess the impact of our AI solution, ensuring fairness and ethical standards.

**4. Mitigate Potential Harms**

Just like adjusting tactics at halftime, we need to reduce any negative impacts our AI might have. We'll explore strategies to keep our AI solution on track.

**5. Operate a Responsible Generative AI Solution**

We'll cover key principles of ethical AI operation, ensuring we're always putting our best foot forward.

**6. Explore Content Filters in Azure AI Studio**

We'll explore content filters to help maintain a responsible AI solution.
