## Overview

Telemetry Everywhere: Instrument agents with granular logging and real-time metrics.

### Continuous Evaluation in Production

Building trustworthy AI doesn't stop at deployment—it requires ongoing vigilance:

- **Automated Monitoring**: Continuous quality and safety checks on production traffic
- **Drift Detection**: Alert when model behavior changes over time
- **A/B Testing**: Compare system versions with real user interactions
- **Feedback Integration**: Capture user corrections and satisfaction signals
- **Automated Red Teaming**: Ongoing adversarial testing with PyRIT

### Azure AI Foundry Monitoring

Azure provides comprehensive continuous evaluation capabilities:

- **Application Insights**: Real-time telemetry for every AI interaction
- **Azure Monitor**: Alerts and dashboards for operational metrics
- **Evaluation Pipelines**: Scheduled batch evaluations on production data
- **PyRIT Integration**: Automated red team scanning in Azure AI Foundry

Continuous evaluation transforms AI from a "deploy and hope" model to a "measure and improve" model. With Azure's monitoring stack and GitHub Actions for CI/CD, you can catch issues before users do.
