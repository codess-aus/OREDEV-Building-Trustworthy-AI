# Chapter 6: Ethical and Policy Alignment  

![Image 6 - Ethics](../images/6.%20Ethics.png)  

## Overview

Agents will face incomplete information, contradictory signals, and shifting objectives - conditions where humans themselves struggle.

Design tactics:
Failover Strategies: For critical processes, agents should be able to gracefully degrade or escalate to human-in-the-loop, rather than making brittle or catastrophic decisions.

Robustness Testing: Simulate edge cases, adversarial scenarios, and “unknown unknowns.” Agents should be tested with the same rigor as disaster recovery drills.

Continuous Learning Loops: Integrate real-world feedback as a core design principle. Agents must be able to learn from past errors and user corrections, not just retrain on static data.
