# Chapter 5: Transparency as a Feature, Not a Checkmark  


![Image 5 - Transparency](../images/5.%20Transparency.png)

## Overview

Transparency is a discipline, not an accessory. In an enterprise, an agent’s decisions can carry millions in revenue implications or regulatory risk. “Black box” behaviour is not acceptable.

What does this look like in practice?

Explainability by Default: Agents must offer human-understandable rationales for their actions, traceable down to the data and logic used. This can mean surfacing the factors behind a pricing decision, the steps taken to escalate a customer issue, or the evidence used to reject a transaction.

Auditability: Every action an agent takes must be logged, timestamped, and attributed to a versioned codebase and model state. This is not just a compliance checkbox, it’s the foundation for debugging, learning, and continuous improvement.

Visibility Layers: Build dashboards where business users and IT alike can see “why” as well as “what.” Imagine the equivalent of a flight data recorder, but for decisions.
