## Practical Examples

### Example 1: Basic Implementation

```python
# Example code for Regulatory Compliance
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Sample implementation
def example_function():
    """
    Demonstrate regulatory compliance concepts.
    """
    # Initialize parameters
    data = np.random.rand(100, 10)
    labels = np.random.randint(0, 2, 100)
    
    # Split data
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
        data, labels, test_size=0.2, random_state=42
    )
    
    print(f"Training set size: {len(X_train)}")
    print(f"Test set size: {len(X_test)}")
    
    return X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test

# Run example
if __name__ == "__main__":
    example_function()
```

### Example 2: Advanced Application

```python
# Advanced implementation example
class TrustworthyAIComponent:
    """
    Advanced component demonstrating regulatory compliance.
    """
    
    def __init__(self, config):
        self.config = config
        self.model = None
    
    def train(self, data):
        """Train the model with trustworthy AI principles."""
        # Implementation here
        pass
    
    def evaluate(self, test_data):
        """Evaluate model with appropriate metrics."""
        # Implementation here
        pass
    
    def deploy(self):
        """Deploy with safety checks."""
        # Implementation here
        pass
```
