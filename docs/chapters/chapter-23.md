# Chapter 23: Risk Mitigation Layers

![Image 23 - Defence in depth](../images/23.%20Defence%20in%20depth.png)

## Overview

We find that most production applications require a mitigation plan with four layers of technical mitigations: (1) the model, (2) safety system, (3) system message and grounding, and (4) user experience layers.  

The model and safety system layers are typically platform layers, where built-in mitigations would be common across many applications. They are built into Azure for you.   

The next two layers largely depend on the application’s purpose and design, meaning the implementation of mitigations can vary a lot from one application to the next.  

Note that, while the foundation model you’re using is obviously an important component of the system, it's not the complete system.
